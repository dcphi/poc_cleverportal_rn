# Getting started
1. You should set up your environment according to the [official documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).
2. **Install project** dependencies by opening the terminal inside the project folder and run the following:

```
npm install
```
3. **Start the application** with:

```
// for iOS
npx react-native run-ios

// for Android
npx react-native run-android
```

4. For **debugging** you can access the *In-App Developer Menu* by shaking your device. You can also use the `⌘D` keyboard shortcut when your app is running in the iOS Simulator, or `⌘M` when running in an Android emulator on Mac OS and `Ctrl+M` on Windows and Linux.
